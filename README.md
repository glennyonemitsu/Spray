Spray
=====

Simple static site framework


Specify flask style routes and template files in `spray.yaml`

    /:
        name:       home
        template:   home.jade
    /contact:
        name:       contact
        template:   contact.jade
    /bio:
        name:       bio
        template:   biography.jade

Since names are provided you can use them with Flask's `url_for` function.

You can also use shorthand or mix both styles:

    /:              home.jade
    /contact:       contact.jade
    /bio:       
        name:       bio
        template:   biography.jade

The `url_for` parameter will then become the full route string if shorthand is
used.

For jinja2 support, just use the `.html` extension.

All templates should be in the `templates/` directory relative to the 
`spray.yaml` file.

All static files should be in the `static/` directory relative to the 
`spray.yaml` file. This `static/` directory is mapped to the root of your 
website domain. As an example, the file `static/robots.txt` would be accessible
at `http://example.com/robots.txt`.

## Quick Start

To install (hopefully sometime soon)

    $ pip install spray 

Start a project
    
    $ spray create_project mysite
    $ ls mysite/

        mysite/spray.yaml
        mysite/templates/
        mysite/static/
        mysite/cache/

Work in development or production mode

    $ spray run_server \
            --mode={development,production} \
            --bind=0.0.0.0:8080


## Serving And Caching Under The Hood

Requests are served by looking for the matching file in `static/`, then as a
flask route if the static file does not exist. Content-Type headers are 
determined by an extension: mime type dictionary. Though by default all route
based requests will be served the `text/html` Content-Type header.

In development mode the server will never use caching. Perhaps in the future it
will constantly watch the `templates/` and `static/` directories.

In production, each request will be cached in `cache/`. The cache key will 
simply be the request path. Even if the template or static file is updated in
the file system, the cache will not be invalidated and updated. In this case the
server must be restart.
